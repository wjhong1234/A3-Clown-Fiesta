/*
---IMPORTANT---
About the "movePlayer" function:
	ONE PARAMETER: Takes in a flag that marks a direction to move in [Left/Right][0/1].
	VOID: Moves player without returning anything.
	USAGE: Used after taking in an input in the game loop in order to move the player in the specified direction.

About the "resetPlayer" function:
	NO PARAMETERS: Everything it needs is in memory.
	VOID: Resets all aspects of the player.
	USAGE: For starting a new game, resetPlayer is used to ensure all player attributes are reset.

About the "resetPlayerPosition" function:
	NO PARAMETERS: Everything it needs is in memory.
	VOID: Resets the position of the player.
	USAGE: Used when the player must be set back to the center of the map after an event ie. collision.

---NOTES---
a revised version of the player, with the addition of clear code and neat documentation.

MOVEPLAYER ALTERS THE PLAYER POSITIONS STORED IN MEMORY.
	- Takes in a Left/Right flag in r0.
	- I am aware I spelt "right" as "rite" in the "goRite" label.

RESETPLAYER RESETS ALL ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLAYER.
	- This includes X Position, Y Position, Fuel and Lives.

RESETPLAYERPOSITION RESETS ONLY THE POSITIONS OF THE PLAYER.
	- X and Y positions of player set to default.
	- Y technically never changes, but we have it in our code for clarity.

PLAYER CONTAINS THE ATTRIBUTES OF A PLAYER: [0]XPOSITION [1]YPOSITION [2]FUEL [3]LIVES.

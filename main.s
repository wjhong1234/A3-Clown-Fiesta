/*
---IMPORTANT---
About "main":
	MAIN: Initializes everything.

About "startGame":
	MENU: Contains the game menu.
	USAGE: Creates and controls all aspects of the main menu.

About "mainLoop":
	LOOP: Limits FPS to approximately 5 frames per second.
	USAGE: Used in the main loop, controls timing of tick and render functions.
	
About "mainEnd":
	END: Clears the screen to end the game.

---NOTE---
main.s is the initial file that starts the game.

a revised version of the loop for controlling FPS, with the addition of clear code and neat documentation.

MAIN AND ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CODE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STARTING AND ENDING THE GAME.
	- Main loop o the entire program.
	- Starts the main menu, which starts the game.

THE LOOP CONTROLS THE FPS OF THE GAME LOOP, AND REQUIRES THE CLOCK TIME OF THE SYSTEM/PROGRAM.
	- Only calls tick and render as major function.
	- This should be the main game loop.
	- Tick contains all game logic and Render contains all the pixel drawing.

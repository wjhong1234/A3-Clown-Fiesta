/*
---IMPORTANT---
About the "xorShift" function:
	NO PARAMETERS: Everything it needs is in memory.
	RETURNS IN R0: Produces a semi-randomly generated number.
	USAGE: Call it where you need it and you get a random number returned in r0.

---NOTES---
a revised version of rng

XORSHIFT PRODUCES A RANDOM NUMBER THAT IS HUGE.
	- Please mask it to a smaller number for use.
	- "LIMIT" register currently unused, but would be used to generally limit number size.
